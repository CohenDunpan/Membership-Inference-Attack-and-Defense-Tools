# Membership-Inference-Attack-and-Defense-Tools
This project is an open-source research toolkit for studying privacy inference attacks and defense mechanisms in machine learning models. Motivated by the severe risks of membership privacy leakage in ML models, the toolkit integrates existing attack and defense methods to support systematic evaluation and benchmarking of privacy risks.
